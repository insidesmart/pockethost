PocketHost is the zero-config 'PocketBase in the cloud' platform. Thank you for everyone's continued support for this project.

## What's New

With this release, you can now adjust the PocketBase version. It will accept semantic versions and semantic version ranges.

With limited testing, it seems that PocketBase will refuse to run on an older version of the database, so there is no danger to accidentally rolling back to an earlier version of PocketBase.
